The unenlightened masses
They cannot make the judgment call
Give up free will forever
Their voices won't be heard at all
Display obedience
While never stepping out of line
And blindly swear allegiance
Let your country control your mind
Live in ignorance
And purchase your happiness
When blood and sweat is the real cost
Thinking ceases, the truth is lost
Don't you worry
You'll be told exactly what to do
I give my people the lives they need
The righteous will succeed
The fires of greed will burn the weak
So we'll make freedom obsolete
Making whole the fabric of society
Collective consciousness controlled as you will see
MIND CONTROL
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
